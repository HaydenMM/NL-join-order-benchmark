# Natural Language Join Order Benchmark
This repo contains the original Join Order Benchmark Queries along with a Natural Language Question that captures the contents of the query.

Using OpenAI's GPT-4o model, we converted these queries into Natural Language via the following prompt:

```
"Your job is to act as a Semantic Parser converting these SQL queries I give you into Natural Language Questions. You should respond with nothing other than the Natural Language Question that accurately captures the SQL query provided. Do Not Respond with anything other than the Natural Language Question. Here is the SQL Query to convert: " + query
```

This repository is not maintained by the original authors of the Join Order Benchmark. The purpose is to ease the distribution of Join Order Benchmark queries (e.g., as a git submodule).

Please be aware that the queries assume the data set from the original paper (see below for the CWI link).
The queries might yield unexpected results when used on the "Frozen Data Set" generated by the step-by-step instructions below.
